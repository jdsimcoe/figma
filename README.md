# Figma for Mac

This is an Electron wrapper for Figma. Simply drag the app to `/Applications/`, boot up, and enjoy!

_NOTE_: I have set up this app to default to open Figma projects in the same window. If you want to open a Figma project in a new window to copy/paste assets between projects, you can simply use `âŒ˜ + click` to open the projects in a new window. When done, you can close the windows. All windows reset when the app is quit or restarted.
